      "\n",
      "A rare home defeat for Chelsea. Recall [my look](http://allanderek.github.io/football-analysis/posts/arsenal-west-ham-09-08-2015/) at Arsenal vs West Ham from the first weekend. It is rare for a team to out-shoot their opposition by so much and still lose. On that day Arsenal out-shot West Ham by 22-8 and on target by 6-4. So I think Chelsea are not quite so dominating here, but still deserved more from the game. In my [shots](http://allanderek.github.io/football-analysis/posts/shots-per-goal/) post we saw that a team in the EPL typically scores one goal for every 4.34 shots on target so Chelsea could have expected 2-3 goals from their shots on target, and could have expected to lose 1-2 goals. Chelsea still look pretty bad, but this was probably an out-lier result.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Villa and Tottenham\n",
      "\n",
      "Both teams here look a bit unfortunate to only attain a single point at home. They appear to have dominated their visitors in both total shots and shots on target.\n",
      "\n",
      "# City, Southampton and Arsenal\n",
      "\n",
      "All had pretty convincing victories. Newcastle look pretty awful at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "# West Ham, Liverpool and Arsenal\n",
      "\n",
      "West Ham didn't really warrant a 3-0 away victory to Liverpool but they certainly warranted a victory, unlike their victory at the Emirates. This probably tells you more about the relative strengths and ambitions of Liverpool and Arsenal than it does about West Ham.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Stoke and Manchester United\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from this, pretty fair draws for Bournemouth-Leicester and, whilst Stoke will feel a little hard done by for their home defeat to West Brom it is hardly much of an outlier. Similarly Manchester United managed to out-shoot Swansea and acheive the same shots on target as their hosts, but 2-1 is certainly within the bounds of a reasonable scoreline given those shot numbers. Particularly given that score-effects tend to affect shot numbers."
