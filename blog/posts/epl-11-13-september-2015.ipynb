      "Chelsea are not having a great start to the season. As others have [pointed out](http://statsbomb.com/2015/09/what-the-hell-chelsea-premier-league-stat-round-up/) this is not a case of having underlying performance and getting a bunch of unlucky results. The performance for Chelsea simply is not there. In this case they have a respectable number of shots at goal, in fact out-shooting their hosts 14-15, but it is the shots on target that reveals that the score line was anything but a fluke. Everton had 9 shots on target to Chelsea's 2. If we take the [average number of shots on target per goal in the premier league](http://allanderek.github.io/football-analysis/posts/shots-per-goal/) and multiply by 9 vs 2 we get an average score line of 2.54 vs 0.57, so 3-1 is perfectly fair scoreline given those shots on targets. I still expect Chelsea to somewhat improve, but they will have to improve their performances rather than just allow luck to regress to the mean.\n",

For Man United, it does have the feel of a an over-performance with some real underlying strength, rather than simply riding their luck. To have scored with all 3 shots on target (one of which was a penalty) would generally leave the opposition feeling a little hard done by. But few who actually watched the game would consider the Liverpool side really worthy of even a draw. In short, Manchester United are becoming an interesting team to watch."

Scoring with 2 out of their 3 shots on target is a very good return. I somehow suspect that West Ham will begin reverting somewhat. But on the positive side, they out-shot their opponents with a healthy 17 shots, albeit conceding 17."
