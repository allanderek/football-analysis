      "So in only 667 of the 11377 games did one team out-shoot the other by 14 shots or more. In 118 of those cases did the team that took the most shots actually lose the game. By contrast there are 412 games in which such a dominant shots team wins the game. I'm a little surprised there are not a larger number of dominant displays where a team really bosses the shots *and* wins the game. Similarly to the teams that win the shots battle at all, when a team wins the shots battle by as much as Arsenal did at the weekend, they are favourites to win the game, the ratio of wins to losses is only approximately 4:1. Good, but not guaranteed.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be clear, I'm not terribly surprised by the 118 number. When a significantly superior team finds themselves behind in a game they tend to ramp up their urgency and hence shots. So it is not surprising to find the odd game in which such a team just does not find away to score. The 118 number represents less than 1% of the games.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am surprised that less 4% of games result in a team bossing the shots by 14 or more and reaping the benefits of this. I guess this demonstrates that once a team obtains a lead (or possibly a comfortable lead) they don't have much adventure about them. Or perhaps they pass up shooting opportunities in the hope of cultivating better chances, whilst hopefully whittling down the clock.\n",
